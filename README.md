## ElectroMagnetism Calculator with Python and Kivy - Readme

This is a Python application using Kivy to perform various calculations in magnetism and electromagnetism.

### Features

* Coulomb's Law
* Electric Field
* Electric Potential Energy
* Electric Potential
* Ohm's Law (Voltage calculation)
* Magnetic Force on Moving Charge

### Running the application

1. **Install Kivy**: Follow the installation instructions for your operating system from the Kivy documentation [https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/installation.html](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/installation.html).
2. **Save the code**: Save the provided Python code in a file named `magnetism_calculator.py`. 
3. **Run the application**: Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run the following command:

```bash
python magnetism_calculator.py
```

This will launch the application with a graphical user interface (GUI).

### Using the application

The application window is divided into sections for each calculation. Each section has text input fields for the relevant variables and a button to trigger the calculation. Enter the values and press the button to see the result displayed in the corresponding label.

* Note that you need to enter numerical values for the calculations.

### Additional notes

* This is a basic example and can be extended to include more functionalities.
* The code uses pre-defined values for constants like permittivity of free space (ε₀) and Coulomb's constant (k). These can be modified if needed.
